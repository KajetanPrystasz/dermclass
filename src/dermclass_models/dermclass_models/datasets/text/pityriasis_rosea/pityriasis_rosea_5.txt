Pityriasis rosea, a rash that usually appears on the torso, upper arms, thighs or neck, may sound worse than it really is. The unsightly condition has a name that’s hard to say: pit-ih-RIE-uh-sis ROW-zee-ah. But it’s common and fairly easy to treat.

Though the exact causes are still unknown, doctors think it’s related to a viral infection, particularly some forms of herpes. It generally affects children, teens, and adults in their 20s, though it can appear on people of any age. It also may affect you if you’re pregnant.

It’s not contagious and, in most people, does not leave marks or scars after it heals.

How Do I Know if I Have It?
Pityriasis rosea starts with a single patch on your back or torso. That’s called the “herald patch” or “mother patch.” It’s usually oval and about 2 to 10 centimeters (a little less than an inch to almost 4 inches) in diameter.

You may find it slightly raised or rough in texture. Sometimes, you may have headache, fever, or sore throat to go along with it.

A week or two after the herald patch appears, it is joined by “daughter patches” – smaller, scaly rashes that form on your chest or back, often in the shape of a Christmas tree. In some cases, it may become itchy, especially when you exercise or it’s exposed to heat.

Because doctors aren’t certain of the condition’s origin, there’s little you can do to prevent it once you have it.
